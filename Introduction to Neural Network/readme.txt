In this repository, I will introduce the basic concepts behind working with neural networks. Now, neural networks and deep learning are behind most of the artificial intelligence that shapes our everyday life today. Think of all the cool features in our phones ranging from face recognition to autocorrect to text auto completes voicemail to text previews. Also the way that we find what we need on the internet using predictive internet searches, content or product recommendations and even self driving cars. Also, many of the classification and regression problems that you need to solve at your business are going to end up being good candidates for neural networks and deep learning as well.
