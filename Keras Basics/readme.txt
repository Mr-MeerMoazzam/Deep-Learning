In this repository, we will be introducing Keras, a Python library that will be used to construct neural networks. We will provide a step-by-step guide on setting up a network structure using Keras, and demonstrate how to build a complete model from start to finish. We will then proceed to write actual code to create our first deep learning network in Python using Keras.
